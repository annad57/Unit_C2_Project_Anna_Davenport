        <p>While writing HTML can be as simple as using an application such as Notepad, that may not be the most practical application as your code advances.</p>
        <p>There are applications called <i>Enhanced Text Editors</i> which aid in writing code by highlighting tags, formatting code, and/or auto-completing tags.</p>
        <p>Enter in IDEs, or <i>Integrated Development Environment</i>. IDEs aid in making coding easier by providing an enhanced text editor, a place to test the code, and tools to debug the code. Some IDEs are for one specific language, while others support multiple languages. Here's a link on top 15 HTML IDEs as of 2024. <a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/website/best-html-css-editor">Top editors</a></p>
        <p>StackBlitz, which this website is coded on, is an online IDE and provides a comprehensive place for code to be written and tested. Others include Replit or Codepen.</p>
