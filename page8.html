            <h3>Metadata and &lt;head&gt;</h3>
            <p>The head element gives useful information for setting up a webpage, and for people who look at your code. All metadata starts with "meta". Some of the most common content in meta are author names, webpage descriptions, character set, and instructions for the webpage, such as constantly refreshing.</p>

            <h3>Unicode</h3>
            <p>Unicode is the universally used method of converting characters into computer-readable code and vice-versa. Unicode is not too important in beginnger HTML. UTF-8 is the most commonly used version of unicode used in the present day, and it maps characters to points of code efficiently.</p>
            <h3>HTML and Unicode Characters</h3>
            <p>Certain characters when writing page-visible text in HTML are ignored, or considered code. Such are the less/greater than symbols, or a non-breaking space. The remedy for this is to use entities, which are strings of code that correspond to a character. For example, less than is "& l t;" minus the spaces, and greater than is "& g t ;" minus the spaces.</p>
            <p>To add in unicode characters such as emojis, the same format is followed: "& # (unicode value) ;". For example, a thumbs up emoji, is "& # 128077 ;". &#128077;</p>
