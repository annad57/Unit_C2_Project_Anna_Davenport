        <p>HTML has some tags that are frequently used, and knowing them is essential. Some are block level, some are inline. What's the difference?</p>
        <h3>Block level elements vs. inline elements</h3>
        <img src="Photos/block.png" alt="block vs inline diagram">
        <p>Block level elements take up an entire line, and cannot be put next to each other. Some examples are <b>&lt;head&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;p&gt;</b>, <b>&lt;h1&gt;</b>, and more. Inline elements rather, can be placed next to each other on the same line. Some examples are <b>&lt;strong&gt;</b>and <b>&lt;i&gt;.</b></p>
        <h3>Headings</h3>
        <p>Headings are block level elements and are headings for a page ordered from 1-6, ranging in size, with &lt;h1&gt; being the largest. Typically you would want to use the headers in order from h1-h6, often not going past h3 or h4.</p>
        <h1>This is h1</h1>
        <h2>This is h2</h2>
        <h3>This is h3</h3>
        <h4>This is h4</h4>
        <h5>This is h5</h5>
        <h6>This is h6</h6>
        <h3>Comments</h3>
        <p>Comments are writing inside the code that are only visible to those who intentionally look at the code. They are used to provide reminders, insight, or any message to one's self or to others reading. The format for a comment is "&lt;!--" before the comment and "--&gt;" after it. There's a comment in this page's code.</p>
